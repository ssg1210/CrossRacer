# CrossRacer
This is a fun 2-D car racing Indi game. Built and implemented by me

# Objective
The objective of the game is to avoid your/user’s car from crashing into an incoming opponent’s(computer) car. The opponent’s car comes from the opposite direction and with variable speed. The game aims to cross as many incoming cars as possible this would count towards your final score. 

# Project Approach  
The project is mainly implemented in the following sequence: - 
1. Initializing the user’s car location and further taking an input to update it’s movement by adding a listener. There are checks to ensure when the button is not tapped the car stops moving. There are four keys used in the game left, right, up, down keys on the keyboard.  
2. Setting the frames of the background and repainting of the images after a counter so that the car appears to be moving. 
3. Positioning of the opponent’s incoming car in a random manner (lane wise) with random speed assigned to each so that the game is interesting. In a similar way “Flappy Birds” game is made. 
4. Updating the x and y coordinates of the cars continuously pre and post collision. 
5. Keeping a counter for the final score displayed at the end of the game.

# Software, Documentation and devices used: 

• Microsoft Visual Studio code 
• Gone through the implementation and working of “flappy Birds” game from which I modeled my idea for the game although flappy birds just uses one user input to increase the y axis and x axis is hardcoded

• Referred to some of the online blogs(https://stackoverflow.com/ etc) to remove some errors from my code 
• Images for the background of the game and the cars were used from google images and bing images.  
• Used https://redketchup.io/ for image resizing, morphing and pixelating
